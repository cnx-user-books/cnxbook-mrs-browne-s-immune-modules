<para id="fs-id1433157">Antibodies were the first part of the adaptive immune response to be discovered by scientists working on the immune system. It was already known that individuals who survived a bacterial infection were immune to re-infection with the same pathogen. Early microbiologists took blood from a patient who was already exposed to a certain pathogen and tested it. They learned that there was a substance in the blood, called an <term>antibody</term> which prevented the individual from getting sick from that pathogen. As studies continued, it was discovered that antibodies prevented the person from getting sick with the same illness a second time.</para><para id="fs-id1855302">What is an antibody? An antibody protein is essentially a secreted from a plasma cell. which develops from B cell. There are five different classes of antibodies found in humans: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE. Each of these has specific functions in the immune response. As researchers learn about them, they are able to learn about the great variety of antibody functions critical to many adaptive immune responses.</para><section id="fs-id1490078">
<title>B Cell Differentiation and Activation</title>
<para id="fs-id1891790">B cells differentiate in the bone marrow. During the process of maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B cells are generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen in T cells.</para>
<para id="fs-id1907767">B cells are activated by binding to antigen. They differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells often leave the lymphoid organs migrate back to the bone marrow, where the whole differentiation process started. After secreting antibodies for a specific period, the B cells die, as most of their energy is devoted to making antibodies and not to maintaining themselves. </para><para id="fs-id2919449">The final B cell is the <term>memory B cell</term>, which results from exposure to a specific pathogen. Memory B cells function in a way similar to memory T cells. They lead to a stronger and faster secondary response when compared to the primary response. They "remember" the antibody for that pathogen which leads to quick production of antibodies.  Often you do not experience any symptoms as the secondary response is so quick and effective.</para></section>

<title>Antibody Structure</title>
<para id="fs-id2308482">Antibodies are proteins consisting of two chains with attached carbohydrates. The <term>heavy chain</term> and the <term>light chain</term> are the two proteins that form the antibody. The main differences between the classes of antibodies are in the differences between their heavy chains. There are 2 regions of the heavy chains known as the <term>constant and variable regions</term>.</para><section id="fs-id2576421">

</figure><para id="fs-id2522080"><term>IgM</term> is the largest of the antibody molecules. IgM is usually the first antibody made during a primary response. Its large shape allows it to bind well to many bacterial surfaces.Thus, it is a very effective antibody against bacteria at early stages of a primary antibody response. </para><para id="fs-id1278918"><term>IgG</term> is the main antibody of secondary responses in the blood. IgG is an antibody that clears pathogens from the blood and can activate complement proteins. This class of antibody is the one that crosses the placenta to protect the developing fetus from disease. </para><para id="fs-id1866202"><term>IgA</term> exists in exocrine gland secretions of the mucous membranes, including mucus, saliva, and tears. Thus, IgA is the only antibody to leave the interior of the body to protect body surfaces. IgA is also of importance to newborns, because this antibody is present in motherâ€™s breast milk (colostrum), which serves to protect the infant from disease.</para><para id="fs-id1236738"><term>IgE</term> is usually associated with allergies and anaphylaxis. It is present in the lowest concentration in the blood. IgE is very specific, such that if a person is allergic to peanuts, there will be peanut-specific IgE bound to his or her cells. In this person, eating peanuts will have a severe allergic reactions, including <term>anaphylaxis</term>, a severe, systemic allergic response that can cause death.</para><para id="eip-204"><term>IgD</term> signals the B cells to be activated. By being activated, they are ready to take part in the defense of the body in the immune system. IgD also plays a role in protecting our respiratory systems from bacteria.</para></section>

<title>Active versus Passive Immunity</title>
<para id="fs-id1390884">Immunity to pathogens, and the ability to control pathogen growth so that damage to the tissues of the body is limited, can be acquired by (1) the active development of an immune response in the infected individual or (2) the passive transfer of immune components from an immune individual to a nonimmune one. Both active and passive immunity have examples in the natural world and as part of medicine.</para>
<para id="fs-id2326407"><term>Active immunity</term> is the resistance to pathogens acquired during an adaptive immune response within an individual. (<link target-id="tbl-ch22_06" document=""/>)  More simply, active immunity occurs when you make your own antibodies. <term> Naturally acquired active immunity </term>, is the response to a pathogen which has invaded one's body that leads to the manufacture of antibodies. <term>Artificially acquired active immunity </term>involves the use of vaccines. A vaccine is a killed or weakened pathogen that, when administered to a healthy individual, leads to the development of antibodies without causing much in the way of symptoms. Thus, with the use of vaccines, one can avoid the damage from disease that results from the first exposure to the pathogen, yet reap the benefits of protection from antibodies. Although you make your own antibodies, a vaccine is considered to be artificial immunity since it needs to be administered to you. The discovery of  vaccines was one of the major medical advances of the twentieth century and led to the wipe out of smallpox and the control of many infectious diseases, including polio, measles, and whooping cough.</para><table id="tbl-ch22_06" summary="">

<para id="fs-id2023055"><term>Passive immunity</term> arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to create their own antibodies. <term>Naturally acquired passive immunity</term> is seen during fetal development. IgG is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the newborn for the first few months of its life.  A newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains from milk during breastfeeding. The fetus and newborn thus benefit from the antibodies of the mother to the pathogens to which she has been exposed. In medicine, <term> artificially acquired passive immunity</term> usually involves injections of immunoglobulins, taken from people or animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen. This treatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen. The downside to both types of passive immunity is the lack of ability to create their own antibodies. Once the antibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited time before they degrade.  Once again an example such as breastfeeding is natural immunity, since it happens without medical administration.  Immunoglobulins are considered artificial immunity since they have to be administered.</para></section>
